I am a biostatistician and researcher with expertise in Bayesian statistics, causal inference, and spatio-temporal modeling of infectious diseases. My research integrates advanced statistical methods, computational biology, and epidemiology to generate evidence that informs public health decision-making. I focus on developing and applying data-driven approaches to strengthen disease surveillance systems, design more effective clinical trials, and support evidence-based health policies.

I am particularly interested in understanding the dynamics of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and chikungunya, using rigorous analytical frameworks to uncover causal relationships and predict transmission patterns. Beyond methodology, I am committed to open science and collaborative research, working across international teams to ensure that statistical innovations translate into real-world public health impact in Africa and globally.
